# Data Visualization Final Project - HeartFit
## A non-technical project exploring the relationship between BMI and Heart Disease

This project explores the relationship between heart disease and BMI using data-driven insights which provide valuable information and acess to an interactive tool.

# 2. Hypothesis
H0: There is no statistical significant difference between BMI categories in experiencing Heart failure.
Ha: There is a statistical significant difference between BMI categories in experiencing Heart failure.

# 3. Exploring Categorical Features
Gender, Chest Pain, Exercise Induced Angina
Count Plot
     
# 4. Exploring Numerical Features
Age, MaxHR, BMI
KDE Plot
Box Plot
     
# 5. Bivarate Visualizations
Swarm Plot
Scatter Plot

# 6. Exploring Additional Variables
Box Plot: Heart Disease, Age, and Sex
Box Plot: Heart Disease, BMI, and Sex

# 7. Correlation Analysis
Spearman Correlation Matrix

# 8. Interactive Dashboards - Jupyter Widgets
BMI and Heart Disease - This interactive dashboard creates a dropdown menu where the user can select different BMI categories, and the scatter plot will dynamically update based on the users BMI category selection. 

Weight and Heart Disease - This interactive dashboard creates a slider where the user can select different weights, and the scatterplot will dynamically update based on the users selected weight.

# 9. Conclusion
## Statistical Tests:
Chi-square Statistic
Mann-Whitney U Statistic
